# Grammar Rules for --- Context Free Language with Left Recursion
#
# The context free rules must be in the Format: A -> B C or A -> B
# The indexed grammar rules must be in the format A[*Y] -> B[*] C or A[*] -> B[*Y] C or A[*] -> B[*] C etc
# epsilon rule has the format: (nothing follows the arrow) A[X] ->
# comment lines begin with "#"
# the start symbol is "START"
#
START -> D START
START -> N T
START -> D
T -> D T
T -> N START
T -> N
# A weakly Equivalent Grammar below, but many strings are ambiguous (have multiple parses).
# I.e,  the grammar below has many more parse trees than the grammar above (but same language).
#X1 -> N
#X1 -> X1 D
#START -> D
#START -> START START
#START -> X1 X1
