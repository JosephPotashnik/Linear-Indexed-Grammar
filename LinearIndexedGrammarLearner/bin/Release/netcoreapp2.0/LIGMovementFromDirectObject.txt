#
# The context free rules must be in the Format: A -> B C or A -> B
# The indexed grammar rules must be in the format A[*Y] -> B[*] C or A[*] -> B[*Y] C or A[*] -> B[*] C etc
# epsilon rule has the format: (nothing follows the arrow) A[X] ->
# comment lines begin with "#"
# the start symbol is "START"

START[*] -> CP[*]
START[*] -> NP CP[*NP]
NP[NP] ->
CP[*] -> IP[*]
IP[*] -> NP VP[*]
VP[*] -> V1 NP[*]
NP -> D N
